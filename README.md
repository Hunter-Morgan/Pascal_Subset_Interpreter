# Pascal_Subset_Interpreter
An interpreter for the Ten Instruction Pascal Subset (TIPS), built in C++.

Description:
This project implements an interpreter for a simplified version of Pascal. It supports variable declarations, arithmetic expressions, conditionals, and control flow constructs like `if`, `while`, and `begin-end` blocks. The interpreter performs lexical analysis with Flex, parsing, and direct evaluation.

Files:
-driver.cpp- Reads the source file, runs the interpreter, and handles command-line flags
-lex.yy.c- Source file generated by Flex
-lexer.h- Tokenizes Pascal source code into a token stream
-nodes.cpp/h- Define and implement abstract syntax tree nodes
-parser.cpp/h- Performs syntax analysis

Test Cases:
1-hello.pas- Basic 'Hello World' program
2-areas.pas- Computes the area of a rectangle
3-bad_prog.pas- Tests for 'identifier not declared' error
4-if_convert.pas- Uses if and else statements to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius
5-multiples.pas- Uses a while loop to compute multiples from 1 to 12
6-lotsovar.pas- Tests for 'identifier declared twice' error
7-bmi_calc.pas- Computes BMI from weight and height
8-mult_table.pas- Creates a multiplication table for the number provided
9-input_test.pas- Tests for integers and counts the number of digiits
10-threedim.pas- Gives the coordinates for a cube with the provided dimensions
11-divisors.pas- Computes the divisors of the provided number
12-not_sample.pas- Tests the NOT operator
13-factorial.pas- Computes the factorial of the provided number

How to Build:
make

How to Run:
./tips <sourcefile.pas>

Command-line Flags:
-p: Displays full parsing
-t: Displays parse tree
-s: Displays user-defined symbols
-d: Displays deletion of tree nodes

Supported Language Features:
- `integer` and `real` types
- `begin ... end` block structure
- `if`, `then`, `else` conditionals
- `while` loops
- Variable assignment (`:=`)
- Basic arithmetic: +, -, *, /
